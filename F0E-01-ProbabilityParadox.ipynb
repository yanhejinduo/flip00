    "We see there are 27 relevant outcomes, of which 13 are green. So 13/27 really does seem to be the right answer. This picture also gives us a way to think about why the answer is not 1/3. Think of the yellow-plus-green area as a horizontal stripe and a vertical stripe, with an overlap. Each stripe is half yellow and half green, so if there were no overlap at all, the probability of green would be 1/2.  When each stripe takes up half the sample space and the overlap is maximal, the probability is 1/3. And in the Problem 3 table, where the overlap is small, the probability is close to 1/2 (but slightly smaller).\n",

First, if you want to convince me, show me a sample space; don't just make philosophical arguments. (Although a philosophical argument can be employed to help you define the right sample space.)

After that point, each additional dollar is worth half as much (only brings half as much happiness). Value keeps accumulating at this rate until we reach the next threshold of \"enough,\" when the utility of additional dollars is halfed again.

    "The [Ellsburg Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellsberg_paradox) has it all: an urn problem; a paradox; a conclusion that can only be resolved through psychology, not  mathematics alone; and a colorful history with an inventor, [Daniel Ellsburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Ellsberg), who went on to become the releaser of the [Pentagon Papers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentagon_Papers).  The paradox is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "> An urn contains 33 red balls and 66 other balls that are either black or yellow. You don't know the mix of black and yellow, just that they total 66. A single ball is drawn at random. You are asked which of these two gambles you would prefer:\n",
    "- **R**: Win 100 for a red ball.\n",
    "- **B**: Win 100 for a black ball.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Separately, you are also asked which of these two gambles you prefer:\n",
    "- **RY**: Win 100 for a red or yellow ball.\n",
    "- **BY**: Win 100 for a black or yellow ball.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many people reason as follows: \n",
    "- **R**: I win 1/3 of the time\n",
    "- **B**: I win somewhere between 0 and 2/3 of the time, but I'm not sure of the probability. \n",
    "- **RY**: I win at least 1/3 of the time and maybe up to 100% of the time; I'm not sure. \n",
    "- **BY**: I win 2/3 of the time. \n",
    "- Overall, I prefer the relative certainty of **R** over **B** and of **BY** over **RY**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The paradox is that, from an expected utility point of view, that reasoning is inconsistent, no matter what the mix of black and yellow balls is (or no matter what you believe the mix might be).  **RY** and **BY** are just the same gambles as **R** and **B**, but with an additional 100 for a yellow ball. So if you prefer **R** over **B**, you should prefer **RY** over **BY** (and if you prefer **B** over **R** you should prefer **BY** over **RY**), for any possible mix of black and yellow balls.\n",
